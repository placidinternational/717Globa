                     <p class="h-light" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="600">The UK is a top destinations to study around the world. With traditions of excellence dating back hundreds of years, high class institutions on every corner, and much more flexibility than many other countries, the United Kingdom has much to offer international students that other English-speaking countries cannot.
</p>
<p class="h-light" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="600">Degrees and qualifications from UK higher education institutions are known around the world as high quality and world class. This standard of excellence is set by some of the older universities with recognizable names, such as Oxford and Cambridge, but the tradition carries. through to many of the universities and colleges throughout the UK. When looking for work in the future, this can be a great selling point in your favour.</p>
<p >Canada is one of the few nations that offer job opportunities to students who have graduated from Canadian Universities and have obtained a Canadian degree. In fact, after finishing their studies, international students can work in Canada for up to 3 years! </p>

<p class="h-light" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="600">An international student in the UK is typically allowed to work up to 20 hours a week during school term, and up to full-time when school is out of term. You should check with your international advisor at your school before starting any work - you do not want to be in violation of your visa, and rules change frequently. Keep in mind it is not always easy to find a job, so relying on work income to fund your entire education is not a good idea. Unless you have employment set up through your school before you arrive, you should plan to fund the entire first year of your studies without any employment income. </p>
